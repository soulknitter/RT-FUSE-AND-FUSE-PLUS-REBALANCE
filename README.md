# RT-FUSE-AND-FUSE-PLUS-REBALANCE
Rebalance for RT Fuse and Fuse Plus.

This mod rebalances several aspects of RT Fuse and Fuse Plus and is soft dependant on my retexture mod. (https://github.com/soulknitter/RT-FUSE-FUSE-PLUS-RETEXTURE)

Changes made:
  - Circuit Breaker no longer requires hi-tech research bench and multi analyzer.
  - Circuit Breaker Recipe changed from 50 Steel, 4 Plasteel, 1 Component to 60 Steel, 2 Component
  - Industrial Circuit Breaker now requires multi analyzer
  - Industrial Circuit Breaker is now a spacer tech
  - Industrial Circuit Breaker Recipe changed from 60 Steel, 5 Component to 80 Steel, 20 Plasteel, 2 Component, 2 Advanced Component
  - Industrial Circuit Breaker has been renamed to Spacer Circuit Breaker
  - Glitter World City Circuit Breaker now requires multi analyzer


These changes were made in order to give a streamlined progression towards reaching each fuse in the research tree. Before that we had 3 fuses in the industrial tech tree and one in ultra tech. Recipes were changed to reflect the upwards curve of building each, better fuse as the player went forward in the game. Research requirements were fixed aswell, because they were rather random.
